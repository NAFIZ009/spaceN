              The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun,
              Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. <br /><br />
              From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three
              times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight
              would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to
              the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system –
              that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense
              atmosphere.
              <br /><br />
              Because of Mercury's elliptical – egg-shaped – orbit, and sluggish
              rotation, the Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again
              from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in
              reverse at sunset.

              Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest
              planetary neighbor. It’s one of the four inner, terrestrial (or
              rocky) planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s
              similar in size and density. These are not identical twins,
              however – there are radical differences between the two worlds.
              <br />
              <br />
              Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and
              it’s perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric
              acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It’s the
              hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer
              to the Sun. Surface temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees
              Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) – hot enough to melt lead. The
              surface is a rusty color and it’s peppered with intensely crunched
              mountains and thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think it’s
              possible some volcanoes are still active.

              made of rock and metal. <br /><br />
              The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets,
              except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and
              goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which
              simply means “the ground.”

              Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet

              Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy
              clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen
              and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm
              bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.

              planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in

              It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as

              Elert Bode. Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery
              Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead, the scientific
              community accepted Bode's suggestion to name it Uranus, the Greek
              god of the sky, as suggested by Bode.​
